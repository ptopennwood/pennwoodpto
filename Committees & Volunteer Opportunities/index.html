		<h4>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h4>
		<p>
			Getting involved is a great way to show your kids that you take an interest in their education and consider school a worthwhile cause.  It's also a great way  to better know the teachers and staff at our school.  The PTO needs volunteers during the school year to handle specific tasks or assist with events.  Some tasks can even be done at home.   You can  check our <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/index.cfm?go=c.SignUpSearch&eid=0BCBC0D9F8C5FD61&cs=09B1BAAD8FCD8B6C7B0764025BB29BCF">Sign-Up Genius</a> to see ongoing volunteer opportunities that would fit your schedule. Please help support Pennwood by volunteering for the PTO.

	<h5>Our continued success depends on you!</h5>
