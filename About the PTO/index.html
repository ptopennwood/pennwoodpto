		<h3>Pennwood PTO Objectives</h3>
		<p>
			The Parent Teacher Organization is a diverse group of parents/guardians, teachers and administrators dedicated to the well-being of students at our school. The PTO's goal is to support an environment where all students will have educational, enjoyable
			and memorable experiences at Pennwood Middle School.

		<h3>Committees</h3>
		<p>
			Every year the PTO forms committees to work on specific tasks throughout the year.  Some committees are ongoing and some occur only once a year. A list of committees and volunteer opportunities with descriptions can be found <a href="../Committees%20%26%20Volunteer%20Opportunities">here</a>. If you decide to chair a committee, you have the flexibility to schedule committee meetings for a time when it's convenient for you.  We have an account set up with <a href="http://www.signupgenius.com/index.cfm?go=c.SignUpSearch&eid=0BCBC0D9F8C5FD61&cs=09B1BAAD8FCD8B6C7B0764025BB29BCF"> PTO Sign-Up Genius </a>that all committee members can use to advertise help needed with their activity or task. Any sign-ups created will be prominently displayed on the main PTO webpage to get you the help needed.  The Executive Team is also available to help with questions and guidance.
